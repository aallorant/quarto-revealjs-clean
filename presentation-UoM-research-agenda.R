  ## Motivating Question: Measuring healthcare quality
  
  ::: incremental

- 5 million of people die from poor‑quality care every year worldwide
* Poor‑quality care is widespread and a top concern for governments

- Characterising and understanding variations in access to quality healthcare quality is important to reduce deaths amenable to healthcare

- **High‑quality healthcare** is defined as *“Health services that increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.”* (Institute of Medicine)  

- **How do we measure quality of care?**
  * Structures $\iff$ material infrastructures that condition an environment conducive or inimical to the provision of good care   
* Processes $\iff$ a direct measure of health providers’ practices
* Outcomes  $\iff$ changes in health status attributable to biological and socio-economic factors, and antecedent care

  ## Health Facility Surveys
  
  ::: incremental

- In many low to middle-income countries (LMICs), routine health information systems are lacking or incomplete

- Most accurate information about healthcare accessibility and quality in LMICs comes from health facility surveys
* USAID's Service Provision Assessment surveys (SPA)
  * World Bank's Service Delivery Indicators (SDI)
* World Health Organisation's Service Access and Readiness Assessment (SARA)

- SPA: stratified surveys collecting information on service availability and quality of care; 35 surveys conducted in 18 countries since 1997. 
  * quality of care indicators include structural quality (physical and human resources) and process quality (provision of care).
