# Proposed Research Program {background-color="#40666e"}

Building on my previous research in population health, social statistics, and demography, my proposed research program is to:

::: incremental

1. Develop statistical methods to **advance precision public health**
2. Advance models and metrics to quantify **health inequalities**
3. Address key challenges in the **measurement of demographic processes**

:::

# **Aim 1**: Statistical Methods for Precision Public Health  {background-color="#40666e"}

## Subnational variations in healthcare quality {#sec-aim1 .smaller}

### Previous work

::: incremental

- **Background**: 5 million of people die from poorâ€‘quality care every year worldwide
  * Variations in access to quality healthcare quality are ~ between and within countries

- **Health Facility Surveys**: In low-resource settings, health information systems lacking or incomplete
  * Information about access and quality of care comes from surveys

- **Modelling Facility Readiness**: Facility surveys can be inconsistent and not powered to produce estimates at subnational level
  * Hierarchical models (i) account for differences between designs, (ii) use space-time correlation and covariates to increase precision at subnational level

- I developed a spatio-temporal model using a [two-step estimation process](#sae-facility) (Allorant, 2023, *Nat. Comm.*)

:::

### Future work 

::: incremental

- IHME Health Systems team is implementing it for modelling ANC readiness in 6 countries

- Developing a [unit-level model](#unit-level), where quality metrics are modelled at the facility-level

## Optimize Data Integration & Enhance HIV Care {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: incremental

- **Survey data** provide snapshot of:
  - HIV prevalence in a sampled population
  - ART coverage among HIV-positive

- **Challenges**:
  - Surveys are typically conducted every few years
  - Sample sizes may be small at sub-national level
  - HIV Surveys (PHIA) were funded by USAID...terminated

::: {.column width="40%"}

![Allorant, 2025, JIAS Under Review](img/key_indicators_ad0.png){width="150%"}

::: incremental

- **Programmatic data**:
  - Tracked continuously, aggregated quarterly
  - Capture numbers of **new HIV diagnoses**, **people currently initiating/on treatment**

:::

. . .

- **Rationale**: **Combining** these data sources can yield **more robust** estimates and reduce uncertainty

## Future work

::: incremental

- Developing automated layer on top of health information system
  * Offers practical tool for rapid analysis and review
  * **Funded by WHO grant**

- Evaluating a pilot study in Nampula province to enhance linkage to care
  * Community vs. facility-based distribution of HIV self-test kits
  * **Funded by British Academy/Leverhulme Trust**

- Integrating sampling techniques with programmatic data
  * Spatial & Adaptive sampling
  * **Funding Plan**: Wellcome Trust Early-Career Award

# Aim 2: Advance models and metrics to quantify health inequalities  {background-color="#40666e"}

## Re-assessing the Wealth Index (WI) as a Measure of socio-economic status {.smaller}

::: incremental

- **Rationale**:
  * Most households surveys collect information on health and demographic indicators (HDI)
  * But not on income or consumption expenditures
- **Challenges**:
  - To assess inequalities in HDI, one needs a measure of socio-economic status (SES)

:::

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: incremental

- **Solution**: a measure of SES (Filmer, Pritchett, 2001) derived from asset data routinely collected in surveys: 
  * asset ownership (TV, car, radio)
  * housing characteristic
  * access to water/electricity 

- **Key assumption**: whether households own an asset depends on their **latent** (unobserved) SES

- Our research **hypothesis**: with mass consumption, asset ownership is **no longer** strongly dependent on SES

### Future Work

**Systematic comparison of poverty maps with Meta**

::: incremental
- In countries with **Consumption & Welfare** surveys:
  * Employ SAE to create poverty estimates at district-level
  * Compare with population-aggregated estimates from Meta

- **Funding Plan**: ESRC Secondary Data Analysis

# Aim 3: Address key challenges in the future of demographic processes' measurement {background-color="#40666e"}

## Measuring the Future: AI, Metascience, and the Reinvention of Official Statistics {.smaller}

. . .

**Objective**: To understand how AI is reshaping official statistics production

. . .

**Key Definitions**:

::: incremental

-	Official Statistics: data and indicators produced by National Statistical Offices (NSOs)

-	AI and Machine Learning: Data-driven algorithms and predictive models that can automate or enhance statistical processes

-	Metascience: Interdisciplinary field that examines how science, technology, and society co-produce knowledge, norms, and institutions

:::

. . .

**Aims**: A comprehensive comparative ethnography of NSOs to study

(i)	Data and Quantification
(ii)	Professions and Practices
(iii)	Public Value and Accessibility

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Step 1**: $\widehat{p_{jts}}$ is the **weighted estimator** of coverage across facilities $i$ in area $j$ at time $t$, derived from survey $s$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{p_{jts}} = \frac{\sum_{i \in S_j} w_{ijs} y_{ijs}}{\sum_{i \in S_j} w_{ijs}}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Step 2**: Define $\widehat{\theta_{jts}} = \text{logit}(p_{jts})$. 

- $\widehat{\theta_{jts}}$ is treated as the "data", and the sampling model is $\widehat{\theta_{jts}} \sim N(\widehat{\theta_{jts}, V_{jts}})$.

- $\theta_{jts}$ is modelled as a function of space-time covariates, and survey effects:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \theta^{l}_{jts} & = \alpha + \boldsymbol{x_{j}}^T \beta + e_j + S_j + \tau_t + \gamma_t + \nu_s
\end{aligned}
$$

## Appendix: Unit-level model for facility surveys {#unit-level .smaller}

::: incremental

- Complex survey design acknowledged by including strata as covariates

- Stronger spatial correlation may exist at smaller spatial scales

:::

. . .

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y(\mathbf{s}_i) &\sim \text{Ber}(p(\mathbf{s}_i))\\
    \text{logit}^{-1}\left(p(\mathbf{s}_i)\right) &= \alpha  + \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{s}_i)\beta +  z_i \gamma + \epsilon_{i} + S(s_i)
\end{aligned}
$$
where:

::: nonincremental

- $z_i$ is the strata of facility $i$ (facility type x managing authority x region), and $\exp(\gamma)$ is the associated odds ration;
- $\epsilon_{i} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{\epsilon})$ is an i.i.d facility-level error term
- $S(s_i)$ is a spatial Gaussian Process
