# Proposed Research Program {background-color="#40666e"}

Building on my previous research and work experiences in population health, social statistics, and demography, my proposed research program is to:

1. Develop statistical methods to **advance precision public health**
2. Advance models and metrics to quantify **health inequalities**
3. Address key challenges in the **measurement of demographic processes**

# **Aim 1**: Statistical Methods for Precision Public Health  {background-color="#40666e"}

## Subnational variations in healthcare quality {#sec-aim1 .smaller}

. . .

**Background**

::: incremental

- 5 million of people die from poor‑quality care every year worldwide

- Variations in access to quality healthcare quality are ~ between and within countries
:::

. . .

**Health Facility Surveys**
  
::: incremental

- In many low resource settings, routine health information systems are lacking or incomplete

- Information about access and quality of care comes from surveys

:::

. . .

**Modelling Facility Readiness**

::: incremental

- Facility surveys can be inconsistent and are not powered to produce estimates at subnational level
- Hierarchical models can (i) account for differences between surveys using different design between, and (ii) use space-time correlation and covariates to produce estimates at subnational level

- I developed a spatio-temporal model using a [two-step estimation process](#sae-facility) (Allorant, 2023, *Nat. Comm.*)
  * IHME Health Systems team is implementing it for modelling ANC readiness in 6 countries

:::

. . .

**Future work**: Developing a [unit-level model](#unit-level), where quality metrics are modelled at the facility-level

## Optimizing Data Integration to Enhance HIV Care

::: incremental

- **Survey data** (e.g., DHS, PHIA) provide snapshots of:
  - HIV prevalence in a sampled population
  - ART coverage among those who test HIV-positive
- **Challenges**:
  - Surveys are typically conducted every few years (infrequent).
  - Sample sizes may be small at sub-national level → **higher uncertainty** when disaggregating.
  - HIV Surveys (PHIA) were funded by USAID...

- **Programmatic data** (e.g., clinic records, testing registers):
  - Tracked continuously or at least more frequently.
  - Capture numbers of **new HIV diagnoses**, **ART initiations**, or **people currently on ART**.

- **Rationale**: **Combining** these data sources can yield **more robust** estimates and reduce uncertainty.

  * Adaptive sampling

## Re-assessing the Wealth Index (WI) as a Measure of socio-economic status {.smaller}

::: incremental

- **Rationale**:
  * Most households surveys collect information on health and demographic indicators (HDI)
  * But not on income or consumption expenditures
- **Challenges**:
  - To assess inequalities in HDI, one needs a measure of socio-economic status (SES)

:::

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: incremental

- **Solution**: a measure of SES (Filmer, Pritchett, 2001) derived from asset data routinely collected in surveys: 
  * asset ownership (TV, car, radio)
  * housing characteristic
  * access to water/electricity 

- **Key assumption**: whether households own an asset depends on their **latent** (unobserved) SES
  * **Known limitation**, the "urban bias": certain assets are **publicly provided** in urban areas

**Hypothesis**: with mass consumption, asset ownership is no longer strongly dependent on SES

## Measuring the Future: AI, Metascience, and the Reinvention of Official Statistics

**Objective**: To understand how AI is reshaping official statistics production

**Key Definitions**:

::: incremental

-	Official Statistics: data and indicators produced by National Statistical Offices

-	AI and Machine Learning: Data-driven algorithms and predictive models that can automate or enhance statistical processes

-	STS (Science and Technology Studies): Interdisciplinary field that examines how science, technology, and society co-produce knowledge, norms, and institutions

:::

. . .

**Approach**: A comprehensive comparative ethnography of National Statistical Offices

. . .

**Aims**:

(i)	Data and Quantification
(ii)	Professions and Practices
(iii)	Public Value and Accessibility

. . .

**Funding**: UKRI Metascience

## Appendix: SAE for facility surveys {#sae-facility}

. . .

**Step 1**: Direct estimate of coverage of indicator $l$ in area $j$ at time $t$ from survey $s$ is the **weighted average** of coverage across health facilities $i$ in area $j$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{p^{l}_{jts}} = \frac{\sum_{i \in S_j} w_{ijs} y^{l}_{ijs}}{\sum_{i \in S_j} w_{ijs}}
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

**Step 2**: Area-level readiness direct estimates modelled as a function of space-time covariates, and survey effects:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \theta^{l}_{jts} & = \alpha + \underbrace{X_{jt}}_{\text{Covariates}} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \overbrace{e_j + S_j}^{\text{Spatial effects}} +\\
 & \overbrace{\tau_t + \gamma_t}^{\text{Temporal effects}} + \overbrace{\delta_{jt}}^{\text{Space-time interaction}} + \overbrace{\nu_s}^{\text{Survey effect}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Appendix: Unit-level model for facility surveys {#unit-level .smaller}

::: incremental

- Complex survey design acknowledged by including strata as covariates

- Stronger spatial correlation may exist at smaller spatial scales

:::

. . .

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y(\mathbf{s}_i) &\sim \text{Ber}(p(\mathbf{s}_i))\\
    \text{logit}^{-1}\left(p(\mathbf{s}_i)\right) &= \alpha  + \underbrace{\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{s}_i)\beta}_{\text{Spatial Covariates}} +  \overbrace{z_i \gamma}^{\text{Strata}} + \epsilon_{i} + S(s_i)
\end{aligned}
$$
where:

::: nonincremental

- $z_i$ is the strata of facility $i$ (facility type x managing authority x region), and $\exp(\gamma)$ is the associated odds ration;
- $\epsilon_{i} \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{\epsilon})$ is an i.i.d facility-level error term
- $S(s_i)$ is a spatial Gaussian Process
